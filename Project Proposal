Assess how consumption of specific nutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc) correlate with prevalence of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, etc)
→ how do nutritional habits among college students aged 18-24 impact their academic performance?

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is your research question? Include the specific question you're setting out to answer. This question should be specific, answerable with data, and clear. A general question with specific subquestions is permitted. (1-2 sentences)

How do aspects of physical and mental health influence the academic performance of college students, specifically examining the roles of nutrition, mental health conditions (such as depression and ADHD), and alcohol consumption?



BACKGROUND & PRIOR WORK: This section will present the background and context of your topic and question in a few paragraphs. Include a general introduction to your topic and then describe what information you currently know about the topic after doing your initial research. Include references to other projects who have asked similar questions or approached similar problems. Explain what others have learned in their projects.

Find some relevant prior work, and reference those sources, summarizing what each did and what they learned. Even if you think you have a totally novel question, find the most similar prior work that you can and discuss how it relates to your project.

References can be research publications, but they need not be. Blogs, GitHub repositories, company websites, etc., are all viable references if they are relevant to your project. It must be clear which information comes from which references. (2-3 paragraphs, including at least 2 references)

Studies such as "The impact of physical activity and fitness on academic achievement and cognitive performance in students" by Singh et al. (2012) have established a positive link between physical health and academic performance. Meanwhile, Eisenberg, Golberstein, and Hunt (2009) have explored the detrimental effects of mental health issues on students' academic outcomes, highlighting the negative correlation between depression, anxiety, and academic performance.
The dataset from Kaggle on "Student Alcoholism and Performance" could provide insights into how substance abuse affects academic achievements. Similarly, research like the BMC Research Notes article on "State of nutrition amongst US college students" could provide insights on the relationship between nutrition and both mental and academic performance. The exploration of mental health datasets, such as the one provided by Kaggle on university student mental health and another on ADHD, can deepen the understanding of the impact of mental health conditions in the academic context.

HYPOTHESIS: What is your main hypothesis/predictions about what the answer to your question is? Briefly explain your thinking. (2-3 sentences)

Our primary hypothesis is that positive aspects of physical and mental health, such as high nutritional intake and low levels of mental health disorders, are associated with improved academic performance. Conversely, negative health behaviors and conditions, such as high alcohol consumption and the presence of ADHD or depression, are likely to correlate with poorer academic outcomes. We predict that by examining specific variables within these categories, we can identify clear patterns that affirm the significance of health in academic success.


DATA: Here, you are to think about and describe the ideal dataset (or datasets) you you would need to answer this question:

What variables would you have/measure?
On whom/what would they be measured/collected?
Is there a specific time period that's important? If yes, describe what the time period is and why.
etc.
Note: For the project proposal, you do NOT have to find the actual dataset(s) needed for your project. We want you to consider what dataset you would really want to answer this question perfectly, even if such data do not exist. For the first checkpoint and onward, you will find and work with available data.

Population: College students aged 18-24 years from a diverse range of institutions to ensure representativeness.
Mental Health Assessments: Prevalence and severity of conditions such as depression, anxiety, ADHD; stress levels; alcohol and substance use frequency and quantity.
Academic Performance Indicators: GPA, attendance records, academic honors, or failures.


ETHICS & PRIVACY: Acknowledge and address any ethics & privacy related issues of your question(s), proposed dataset(s), and/or analyses. Use the information provided in lecture to guide your group discussion and thinking. If you need further guidance, check out Deon's Ethics Checklist. In particular:

Are there any biases/privacy/terms of use issues with the data you propsed?
Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis? (For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?)
How will you set out to detect these specific biases before, during, and after/when communicating your analysis?
Are there any other issues related to your topic area, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact?
How will you handle issues you identified?
(1-2 paragraphs)

The datasets proposed, such as those from Kaggle, typically come with agreements that ensure the data was collected ethically and with the participants' consent. However, it is important to anonymize any data further to protect individuals' identities, especially when dealing with sensitive information like mental health conditions and academic performance.
Bias is another critical concern. Our datasets might not equally represent all demographic groups, potentially skewing results. For instance, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds might be underrepresented in surveys about nutrition due to limited access to resources. We plan to address these biases by carefully examining the demographic distribution of our data sources and considering these limitations in our analysis and conclusions.
